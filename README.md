# Fractal Generator

This project is currently under development. The final result will be a real-time Fractal Generator that allows the user to visualize well-known Computer Science algorithm's complexity. 

A fractal is a psichodelic algorithm-generated image that is self-like through different scales. The user will be able to zoom in and out different regions of the fractal in order to explore it. It will also have different presets that will allow the user to visualize and compare the Time Complexity of some of the most popular computer science algorithms (e.g. binary search, euclidean algorithm, Huffman algorithm, Djiistra...).

Progress checklist:
+ Application Engine 
+ Log System
+ Function Timer
+ Bitmap Images Generation
