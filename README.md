# Welcome to Fractal Generator - A real-time fractal world explorer

The Mandelbrot fractal is a psichodelic mathematically-generated image that is self-like through different scales. The user will be able to zoom in and out different regions of the fractal in order to explore it. It will also have different presets that will allow the user to visualize and compare the Time Complexity of some of the most popular computer science algorithms (e.g. binary search, euclidean algorithm, Huffman algorithm, Djiistra...).

## Getting Started

You can either clone the repository and generate the project with GenerateProject.bat or directly access the lastest binaries.<br/>

Use UP and DOWN to zoom in and out to the cursor location. Use LEFT and RIGHT to decrease or increase the fractal detail level (with a performance impact)<br/>
