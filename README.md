# Welcome to the Fractal Generator

This project is currently under development. The final result will be a real-time fractal explorer that will allow visualizing the time complexity of the algorithms most commonly used in computing.

A fractal is a psichodelic algorithm-generated image that is self-like through different scales. The user will be able to zoom in and out different regions of the fractal in order to explore it. It will also have different presets that will allow the user to visualize and compare the Time Complexity of some of the most popular computer science algorithms (e.g. binary search, euclidean algorithm, Huffman algorithm, Djiistra...).

## Getting Started

You can either clone the repository and build the project with GenerateProject.bat or directly access the lastest binaries:<br/>

Use UP and DOWN to zoom in and out to the cursor location. Use LEFT and RIGHT to decrease or decrease fractal detail<br/>
